# RLY TS

This repo contains packages for RLY Network's typescript library, CLI tool and example apps. These repos give you the tools to build a tokenized economy with fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens and coordination mechanisms. Each package contains its own README file with details about installation and usage

An example app using these repos can be found [here](https://rly-ts-mexux7zlk-rly-network.vercel.app/) ([code](https://github.com/rally-dfs/rly-ts/tree/main/packages/examples/react/app/src))
